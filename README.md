# Smart-Parking-System
The Smart Parking System uses IR sensors, Servo Motors, and RFID Tags coordinated by a Raspberry Pi to monitor parking slot occupancy via an Android app using MQTT. It detects vehicles, provides data for available spaces, and grants access exclusively to registered users, optimizing parking management.
